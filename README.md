Building 2 Convolutional neural networks (CNN) with early stopping using the MNIST dataset and comparing the number of filters and kernels on each one to see which compares better.

Each CNN consists of: Three 2D convolutional layers with 3x3 kernels, where each one of the first two is followed by a 2x2 max polling layer and for the classification part of the model I used two fully connected layers.

1st CNN:
